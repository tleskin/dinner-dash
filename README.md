## About

HipsterBytes is an e-commerce restaurant website created with Ruby on Rails. It authenticates with either email and a password or Twitter OmniAuth. Some added features include order filtering as an admin, email with SendGrid and simulated credit card payments with Stripe.

Credit card payments can be tested in the app by using the credit card number "4242 4242 4242 4242" and then any expiration date after the current date and any CVC number.

It was a team project called Dinner Dash that was completed as part of the curriculum at the [Turing School of Software & Design](http://turing.io/).
